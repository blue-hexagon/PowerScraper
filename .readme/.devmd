## Count LOC in Rider
- Ctrl + Shift + F (to open global search)
- Use regex mode (check "regex" checkbox)
- In the searchbox, enter only a caret "^" (without the quotes)
- You may want to limit the search to a specific directory, via the "directory" tab
- Hit the "Open in Find Window" button on the bottom-right
- If it asks whether you want to continue, press "Continue"
